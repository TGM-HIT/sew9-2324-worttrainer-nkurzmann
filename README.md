My Code for the task "Worttrainer Reloaded". The target is to recreate and improve the Worttrainer we once wrote in the third Grade. New features beeing the changeable Serialization Methods and UI.

A Rechtschreibtrainer has mulitple Woerterpaare Obejcts, which contain a Word and an URL. The Rechtschreibtrainer also uses the Speicherstrategie Interface and can choose a way to preserve the data.
